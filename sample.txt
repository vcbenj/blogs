  "content": "Learning to be wrong in life is a very important skill. Plato's main goal in life was to be wrong. He would do this when talking to people hoping he could prove himeself wrong by asking probing questions. If the anwsers weren't satisfactory he would have failed in his goal.
  
  The implications of being wrong are that we are learning instead. Everytime we learn that we are wrong we gain futher knowledge of the truth. Pluto's excersises weren't because he was a masicast who loved pain. But rather because he loved truth and the process of finding it. 
  
  In our own busy lives when we strive to become wrong we set aside our pride in the pursuit of something more. We decide that our main goal should be the truth. Don't get me wrong we shouldn't try to be wrong when we aren't. Instead we should look to validate our ideas through an intense screenign process and always be willing to change information. "
